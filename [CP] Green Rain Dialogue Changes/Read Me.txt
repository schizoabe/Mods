Green Rain dialogue changes:

The way the NPCs handle green rain is strange to me. They act like it's dangerous and no one should go out in it, yet they are gathering at the Saloon. How did they get there without getting wet from the rain? How did the letter even get to you without someone getting wet? For the NPCs that stay home, why are they still scared after knowing nothing bad happened to you? 

You have the option to turn off dialogue changes for each NPC.
