	"Abigail.CT.townbreakfast.Marriage": "Hey, @, I got a ticket to this 'Omelet Breakfast' Gus is offering. Should we go, or...?$u#$b#...Oh, you're helping him? Why didn't you say so earlier? I guess we're going, then.$h",
	"Leah.CT.townbreakfast": "I've heard about Gus's famous omelet, but he's never advertised making it.$u#$b#I guess I'll just have to go to this 'Omelet Breakfast' to see what it's all about.",
	"Leah.CT.townbreakfast.Marriage": "I've heard about Gus's famous omelet, but he's never advertised making it.$u#$b#Come with me to the breakfast, @? It'd be nice to spend a morning with you at the Saloon.$l",
	"Penny.CT.townbreakfast": "Gus personally came to give Mom and I cheap tickets for the breakfast he's holding. It was kind of nice.$h#$b#Plus, it's all you can eat, and we can take home leftovers. That will more than pay back how much we spent on the tickets.",
	"Penny.CT.townbreakfast.Marriage": "Gus personally came to give Mom cheap tickets for the breakfast he's holding. She wouldn't stop talking about it when I last visited.#$b#We're going the day of, right? It'd probably be good to visit Mom and support the community.",
	"Maru.CT.townbreakfast": "Out of curiosity, @, what do you think makes an omelet tasty?#$b#Is it ingredient to egg ratio? Length of time cooked? Are there specific qualitative variables you'd think would affect the taste?$u#$e#Don't worry if you can't answer now. The Omelet breakfast will be a perfect time to get data along with good food.$h",
	"Haley.CT.townbreakfast": "...Honestly, Stardrop Breakfast isn't bad. So this Omelet Breakfast actually sounds....$7#$b#Kind of nice, actually. But don't tell Emily I said that.",
	"Emily.CT.townbreakfast": "Gus actually asked me to help with the prep for the Omelet breakfast. It's actually really involved!#$b#It's no festival, but it's still a lot more work than you'd think.",
	"Harvey.CT.townbreakfast": "I'll be on hand to make sure no one chokes on eating any of the Omelet at the upcoming breakfast.#$b#I'll also be there for the food, of course. But mostly to make sure everyone doesn't end up choking from eating too quickly.$h",
	"Elliott.CT.townbreakfast": "A feast! A veritable feast! Gus is truly generous to give us the opportunity to indulge ourselves so thoroughly at this 'Omelet Breakfast'.#$b#...Unfortunately, I have no fridge to store leftovers, so I will have to eat what I can instead of taking anything with me.$s",
	"Elliott.CT.townbreakfast.Marriage": "A feast! A veritable feast! Gus is truly generous to give us the opportunity to indulge ourselves so thoroughly at this 'Omelet Breakfast'.#$b#And living with you, I have a fridge for leftovers! Truly, I can take the experience with me and share it with you in our humble abode.$l",
	"Alex.CT.townbreakfast": "Omelets are good, they just can't compare to sausages and a stack of pancakes for a morning breakfast.#$b#But I won't turn down cheap food from Gus - his Stardrop Breakfast's already great, so I'll take an omelet.$h",
	"Alex.CT.townbreakfast.Marriage": "Hey, we're going to that Omelet Breakfast of Gus's, right?$9#$b#Oh, you already got tickets? Nice.#$e#...Why am I so interested in going to the breakfast? I mean, I've tried it already and it's pretty good.#$b#Plus, Grandma and Grandpa are going, so I didn't really want to disappoint either of 'em.$h",
	"Sebastian.CT.townbreakfast": "....ugh. Sometimes I hate my family.$a#$b#They *know* I hate omelets and waking up early. Why on earth am I being dragged to some omelet breakfast?$a",
	"Sebastian.CT.townbreakfast.Marriage": "...Are we going to the omelet breakfast?#$e#Don't get me wrong, @, I still hate omelets. It just... probably makes sense to go.#$b#Gets us free food, counts as visiting family, helps you help Gus, etcetera. I'll stomach it for one day.$7",
	"Sam.CT.townbreakfast": "Hmmmmmm... I wonder if I should try and put hot sauce on the omelet as a prank.#$b#Nah, it'd be too obvious. Plus Gus lets us play pool on Fridays right now and I'd like to not make him hate us.$10",
	"Shane.CT.townbreakfast": "... Omelet's aren't terrible. Cheap omelets from the Saloon are pretty good.$u#$b#I guess the price is just dealing with people that early.$s",
	"Shane.CT.townbreakfast.Marriage": "So this Omelet breakfast thing... you think it's legitimate?$u#$e#Oh, you're helping Gus out with it? Cool. I guess we'll get some omelets together next week, then.$l",
	"Kent.CT.townbreakfast": "I don't mind omelets. I just have to not think about their ingredients too hard.$s#$b#The eggs are fine. The milk... *shudders*$5",
	"Jodi.CT.townbreakfast": "Vincent's been excited for the upcoming omelet breakfast. He keeps saying he's going to beat his older brother in an eating contest.#$b#Normally I'd be concerned, but it's all you can eat, so we don't have to worry about them eating through the food budget for the week because of it.$h",
	"Vincent.CT.townbreakfast": "@? What's a Stardrop Omelet?$3#$b#Mom said we're having a 'Stardrop Omelet' breakfast next week, but I don't know what those are.$3#$e#Maybe I should ask Miss Penny if she can cook Stardrop Omelets for us? I wanna know what they taste like.",
	"Marnie.CT.townbreakfast": "I wasn't expecting Gus to want to make his omelet so soon!$4#$b#And the amount he wanted... if I gave him all of my chicken and duck eggs, it still wouldn't be enough.$s#$e#I guess it's a good thing he was able to get the rest of the eggs from CONFIG.",
	"Marnie.CT.townbreakfast.Immersion": "I wasn't expecting Gus to want to make his omelet so soon!$4#$b#Thank you for donating the eggs, @. I don't think I could have given Gus quite that many.$h",
	"Jas.CT.townbreakfast": "Aunt Marnie's always talked about how good Gus's omelets are, but I've never had one.#$b#Do you think they're better than Aunt Marnie's cooking, @?$3",
	"Clint.CT.townbreakfast": "Emily showed up this morning and told me about some 'Stardrop Omelet Breakfast'. Apparently tickets are pretty cheap.#$b#Even if it wasn't a favor for a friend, I'd still go - Gus's food is pretty good.$h",
	"Willy.CT.townbreakfast": "To tell the truth, @, I am not a fan of omelets on their own.#$b#But Gus's famous omelet is seasoned perfectly, so it will be a treat to attend this 'Omelet Breakfast' he's holding.$h",
	"Robin.CT.townbreakfast": "So I hear Gus is holding an Omelet Breakfast!$h#$b#I've always wanted to take Demetrius to one, but he's been busy. And Gus likes to keep the famous omelet exclusive.#$e#...And Sebastian hates omelets, for some reason.#$b#And Maru gets about as wrapped up in experiments as her father does...$s#$e#But I'll figure a way to get them all to attend this time.$h",
	"Demetrius.CT.townbreakfast": "Robin's been trying to convince me to come when Gus has made his famous omelet for years, but I've been busy pretty much every single one.#$e#I suppose at the very least it's worth a try. I just don't quite see how different it is from an omelet with seasoning.$3",
	"Pierre.CT.townbreakfast": "Gus must be really confident if he's selling those Stardrop Breakfast tickets for so cheap.$4#$b#I have every confidence in my store's produce, but even I have to make sure I make the money I spent on it back.",
	"Caroline.CT.townbreakfast": "I generally prefer cooking my own meals to eating in the Saloon - it's why I don't often go there, even when my husband does.$s#$b#Still, Pierre is as frugal as he is ambitious, so I suppose we will be taking a family outing to this 'Stardrop Omelet Breakfast'.",
	"Pam.CT.townbreakfast": "I was all set to say no to Gus and his crazy breakfast idea - I mean, did you hear how many eggs he needed?#$b#Then he told me how much it was and that there'd be leftovers. You couldn't sign Penny or I up fast enough!$h",
	"Pam.CT.townbreakfast.PennyMarried": "I was all set to say no to Gus and his crazy breakfast idea - I mean, did you hear how many eggs he needed?#$b#Then he told me how much it was and that there'd be leftovers. You couldn't sign me up fast enough!$h",
	"Lewis.CT.townbreakfast": "I haven't seen a community initiative like this in a while! I'm surprised Gus isn't making it a regular festival!$h#$b#Although I suppose feeding the whole town would be hard to do normally, without town funds...$s#$e#What do you think, @? Should we finance an Omelet Festival?$h",
	"Evelyn.CT.townbreakfast": "Gus told us about the Omelet Breakfast and we were the first to sign up.#$b#We've heard of his business troubles, and we want to support him as much as we can.$h",
	"George.CT.townbreakfast": "Was kind of Gus to give us tickets to an all you can eat Omelet Breakfast.$h#$b#But none of those young'uns better poison the omelet like they did the Luau soup that one year!$a",
	"Sandy.CT.townbreakfast": "Hello there sweetie!~ I hear your Saloon is having a special breakfast soon!$h#$b#I'll try and make it, but I'm not certain I'll be available then.#$b#Guess you'll just have to wait and see if I show up!$h",
	"Gus.CT.townbreakfast": "Setting up an event like this is almost as much work as a festival!$h#$b#Still, I hope it's worth it. If not, at least I can say I tried.",
	
	//Stardrop Omelet Breakfast Postlude (Post-Event 5)
	
	"Abigail.CT.completebreakfast": "I take back anything I said about Gus's omelet-making skills. That was delicious.$h#$b#Sam and Sebastian are already down for meeting up there on Sunday mornings. It'll be nice to have a dedicated day to spend with friends.",
	"Abigail.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "I take back anything I said about Gus's omelet-making skills. That was delicious.$h#$b#You want to go out and grab some Stardrop Breakfast with me some morning? We could make it a date, if you want.$l",
	"Leah.CT.completebreakfast": "That omelet was divine. Goat cheese? Fresh hot pepper and tomato? Newly foraged Purple Mushrooms??#$b#I'll have to limit myself to brunch with Elliott just to make sure I eat other things for a morning meal!$h",
	"Leah.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "That omelet was divine. Goat cheese? Fresh hot pepper and tomato? Newly foraged Purple Mushrooms??#$b#Give me that omelet and stay with me one day, @. I think I've just found a new definition of my perfect morning.$l",
	"Penny.CT.completebreakfast": "We have so much leftover omelet we could probably eat it for a week straight!$h#$b#We'll still have variety, but Gus basically just took care of breakfast for us for a week. We're really thankful.#$e#Mom's planning on going to breakfast hours every Thursday. If I'm not busy, I think I'll join her.",
	"Penny.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "I think Mom nearly cried when Gus gave her enough omelet for a week. She swore she'd do right by him and pay her tab more often.#$b#She asked if I'd be willing to help her keep that promise and make it a family breakfast day. I told her if I wasn't busy, I'd go.#$b#So if I head out on Thursdays, I'm probably going to the Saloon. Join me sometime, okay?$l",
	"Maru.CT.completebreakfast": "That Omelet was so good, I forgot to ask people what made a perfect omelet to them.$9#$b#I guess I'll just have to go back for seconds! Penny and Mom already asked me if I could spare some breakfast time for them, so I'll have the opportunity.$h",
	"Haley.CT.completebreakfast": "I kind of miss Stardrop Breakfast not being too crowded. It had that sort of quiet cafe type of feeling in the mornings.$s#$b#But then again, no one visits on Saturdays but Emily and I, so it's still pretty good for us for now.",
	"Haley.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "I kind of miss Stardrop Breakfast not being too crowded. It had that sort of quiet cafe type of feeling in the mornings.$s#$b#But then again, no one visits on Saturdays but Emily and I, so it's still pretty good for us for now.#$e#You should join us one day, dear. Or maybe we could go together sometime, just the two of us?$l",
	"Emily.CT.completebreakfast": "Whew! I think I ate more eggs at the breakfast than I have in ages!$h#$b#Gus let me take home as many leftovers as I want, too, since I helped with the cleanup. I'll have plenty of breakfast to last me for a while.",
	"Emily.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "Whew! I think I ate more eggs at the breakfast than I have in ages!$h#$b#I recognized our eggs in that omelet, by the way. Thank you for helping Gus, @.$l",
	"Harvey.CT.completebreakfast": "As a doctor, I was concerned about how much omelet everyone ate at the breakfast...$s#$b#But as someone who likes good food, I could see why. I'll probably at least go for some coffee at some point.$h",
	"Harvey.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "As a doctor, I was concerned about how much omelet everyone ate at the breakfast...$s#$b#But as someone who likes good food, I could see why. I'll probably at least go for some coffee at some point.$h#$e#If you want, maybe we could... go together?$l",
	"Elliott.CT.completebreakfast": "I am truly blessed to live in this town with such generous neighbors. The breakfast has nurtured my body and soul immensely.#$b#The omelet inspired me for a specific portion of my next book. I apologize, @, but I must depart and write before my idea escapes me!$7",
	"Elliott.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "I am truly blessed to live in this town with such generous neighbors. The breakfast has nurtured my body and soul immensely.#$b#The omelet inspired me for a specific portion of my next book. I apologize if I am inattentive for a spell at home, @.$s#$b#My mind simply cannot let go of an idea once it has inspired me. I must commit my imagination to paper posthaste!$h",
	"Alex.CT.completebreakfast": "That omelet was fantastic. Though it could have used more meat in it, really.#$b#What? Yeah, I know a lot in Pelican Town are pescatarian, but I was really hoping for some sausages on the side.$h",
	"Sebastian.CT.completebreakfast":  "...I still hate omelets.$a#$b#...but that one wasn't bad, I guess. I still better not get dragged to another one.",
	"Sebastian.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "...I still hate omelets.$a#$b#...but that one wasn't bad, I guess. I'd rather not have to eat one again, though.#$e#...Hey, @. You want to have breakfast there one morning?$7#$b#It'd be... nice to take some time for ourselves, if we already get up that early.$l",
	"Sam.CT.completebreakfast": "Oh man, @! You should have been there when we all arrived! That omelet was freakin' huge!$h#$b#I'm pretty sure that was bigger than Abigail, Sebastian, and me all together.$h#$e#Oh, and I managed to put hot sauce... on Sebastian's omelet. Don't worry, he suggested it.#$b#Why? Well, when your good friend hates omelets, you do what you have to do to give them an excuse to stop eating.$10",
	"Shane.CT.completebreakfast": "Heh. Stardrop Breakfast, huh? Seems too good to be true.$u#$b#Guess it works. Better on my wallet, anyway.#$e#Jas wanted to spend some time with me on Thursdays, too, so I guess we can start by getting breakfast from the Saloon now.$6",
	"Shane.CT.completebreakfast.Marriage": "Heh. Stardrop Breakfast, huh? Seems too good to be true.$u#$b#Guess it works. Would be a nice place to spend on a date, too, I guess.$l#$e#I might head out on Thursdays now, too, just so you know. Jas wants to spend more time with me.$u#$b#And, well, I haven't exactly spent much time with her after I married you, so I kind of wanted to be a better godfather to her.",
	"Kent.CT.completebreakfast": "Haven't had an Omelet that good in a while.$h#$e#Gus and I are still finalizing the details on my takeover of the Saloon on Mondays. Should be done soon, though.",
	"Jodi.CT.completebreakfast": "That was a wonderful breakfast, @. Thank you for organizing it with Gus.#$b#The leftovers are appreciated as well, of course. Vincent lit up when he heard we'd have omelet tomorrow morning too.$h",
	"Vincent.CT.completebreakfast": "@! @!! The Omelet was huuuuuuge!$h#$b#And it was sooooo good! Can you tell Mom I want Stardrop Omelets every morning?",
	"Marnie.CT.completebreakfast": "I think that was probably Gus's finest work, @. The taste of %farm eggs was delightful.$h#$e#What? Did I say something strange?$3",
	"Jas.CT.completebreakfast": "Farmer @? Why do adults like putting a lot of weird stuff in their omelets?$3#$b#I like tomatoes and cheese and peppers, but mushrooms are gross.$s#$e#Aunt Marnie picked them off my omelet though, so I still got a lot to eat!$h",
	"Clint.CT.completebreakfast": "I forgot how awkward it is around the rest of the town when you've got nothing in common with them.$s#$b#I guess the food was worth it, at least.",
	"Willy.CT.completebreakfast": "Might be an unpopular opinion, @, but I preferred Gus' original omelet.#$b#But even I know you have to try something new sometimes. It's part of being alive.#$e#It'll also be nice to have a warm meal before a rainy day on the ocean, too. Thanks for helping Gus, @.$h",
	"Robin.CT.completebreakfast": "So, @, Gus tells me you're the person who donated the goat cheese for the omelet breakfast.#$b#Want to send me over some? That was probably the best part of that giant egg we all took a bite of.$h",
	"Demetrius.CT.completebreakfast": "All evidence I've previously seen indicates that omelets and fruits don't go well together. The tastes just... don't mix.$3#$b#But that omelet? Probably the first outlier I've ever seen. Tomatoes in an omelet was actually pretty good!$h",
	"Pierre.CT.completebreakfast": "%Pierre looks to be in shock.#$b#But... he never stopped in once... and that omelet was...$4#$e#Say, @... you wouldn't think that Pelican Town would be interested in a large supply of eggs now, do you?$4",
	"Caroline.CT.completebreakfast": "I'm not certain whether it's good for you, but the omelet was pleasant enough to eat.#$b#I suppose it'd be a nice date spot for Pierre and I or a nice family meal area for the two of us and Abigail, though.",
	"Caroline.CT.completebreakfast.AbigailMarried": "I'm not certain whether it's good for you, but the omelet was pleasant enough to eat.#$b#I suppose it'd be a nice date spot for Pierre and I or a nice family meal area for the two of us and Abigail, though.#$e#Perhaps you could help convince her to attend a breakfast or two, @? I know the word of someone important to her would carry some weight.",
	"Pam.CT.completebreakfast": "Hey, kid! I hear you're to thank for setting up this 'Stardrop Breakfast'!$h#$b#Seriously though. Thanks. This bought Penny and I breakfast for a bit, and it's damn good food. I owe ya one, kid.",
	"Pam.CT.completebreakfast.PennyMarried": "Hey, kid! I hear you're to thank for setting up this 'Stardrop Breakfast'!$h#$b#Seriously though. Thanks. This bought me breakfast for a bit, and it's damn good food. I owe ya one, kid.",
	"Lewis.CT.completebreakfast": "I knew I recognized those eggs from a farm nearby!$h#$b#Thank you for helping Gus make that new omelet, @. It tasted better than it ever has!$h",
	"Evelyn.CT.completebreakfast": "Oh, the omelet was wonderful, dearie. I haven't had food like that in a long time.#$b#Gus shared the recipe with George and I, too, so I can make some changes for George. He'll love adding leeks to his omelets in the morning.$h",
	"George.CT.completebreakfast": "Outside of all the other people there, the omelet wasn't half bad. Could have used a few leeks, though.#$b#Evelyn got the recipe so I could try it with them. Those leftovers will taste even better than it did fresh now!$h",
	//"Sandy.CT.completebreakfast": "Sorry, @, I couldn't get away from the shop to attend your breakfast. I was sad I couldn't spend some time in the Valley with you or Emily.$s#$b#Emily brought me some leftovers, though. The omelet was pretty good, although maybe I enjoyed it because Emily was bringing it, hmmm?#$e#You're welcome to bring me an omelet any time, @. I'm sure I'd like it if you brought me an omelet, too.", //Unused as Sandy fit within the event.
	"Sandy.CT.completebreakfast": "Visiting me after breakfast, @?$h#$b#The omelet your chef cooked was nice. I think it was nicer to spend time around your community though.#$e#I didn't even recognize some of the people! I guess there's a lot more people I haven't been introduced to yet.#$b#If you know everyone in town, @, want to introduce me?$h",
	"Gus.CT.completebreakfast": "Stardrop Breakfast has been booming ever since the Omelet Breakfast!$h#$b#Thank you again for your help, @. I'm still working on a little extra reward for you - hopefully it should be done soon.",
	"Linus.CT.completebreakfast": "Gus offered me some of the leftover omelet he cooked for the community the other day.#$b#I appreciated he thought of me, but I preferred to get my food from nature if at all possible.$h",
	
	
	// Kent cooks at Saloon (Post- Aux Event 1)
	
	"Kent.CT.kentcook": "Hey, farmer. Stop by the Saloon on Mondays, and I'll fix up a good breakfast for you.$h#$b#Gus also mentioned you get a nearly-free breakfast for your help, so it'll be almost on the house.$h",
	"Jodi.CT.kentcook": "I do worry the Saloon won't be a good environment for Kent... he's had some unexpected things cause problems for him since he came back.$s#$b#But I trust my husband. If he thinks he can cook at the Saloon without issues, then he has my support.",
	"Vincent.CT.kentcook": "Farmer @, did you hear? Dad's going to cook us Stardrop Omelets on Mondays!$h#$b#Dad also said he'd cook for everyone else too, so you have to come sometime, okay? He's really good at pancakes!",
	"Sam.CT.kentcook": "Dad's pretty stoked about being able to cook using Saloon-quality ingredients.#$b#I think he really just wanted an excuse to wow Vincent with some fancy pancakes, but who am I to judge?$h",
	
	// Shane does CC Job (Post- Aux Event 2A)
	
	"Shane.CT.ccShane": "I'm feeling a little less useless lately.$u#$b#It's nice to have another job lined up now that Joja's gone. I'm not just... moping around in my own head anymore, at least.",
	"Shane.CT.ccShane.Marriage": "Hey. I'm doing a favor for Gus and taking inventory for him on Tuesdays.$u#$b#Getting out of the house probably will be good for me, too. Plus, not many use the kitchen that day anyway.",
	"Marnie.CT.ccShane": "Shane seems to have been a little happier since Gus hired him to inventory the Community Center.$h#$b#I'm glad he's been able to do something to keep himself occupied. I know he struggles with that, sometimes.$s",
	"Jas.CT.ccShane": "Uncle Shane and I walk together on Tuesdays in the morning before I go off to school, now.$h#$b#He says he'll try and walk home with me, too. I think he likes working for Mister Gus!",
	
	// Sam does CC Job (Post- Aux Event 2B)
	
	"Abigail.CT.ccSam": "Sam seems pretty happy about the new job of his - it honestly sounds kind of boring, though.$9#$b#Honestly, if I had to stand in a room and just count things, I think I'd lose my mind.$u",
	"Sebastian.CT.ccSam": "Sam's been pretty happy he's gotten some extra cash working for Gus on Tuesday.#$b#Heh. Never thought I'd see Sam happy to take more responsibilities.$7",
	"Sam.CT.ccSam": "Hey, if you're trying to find me on Tuesdays, I'm doing some work for Gus now!$h#$e#What am I doing? Inventory. I do that, Gus gets to cook for for people on Tuesday mornings.",
	"Kent.CT.ccSam": "...I'm proud of Sam for taking initiative to find a job. He's growing into a fine young man.$h#$b#...Sometimes that just makes me realize how much I've missed, though.$s",
	"Jodi.CT.ccSam": "I was worried when Joja went out of town that Sam would just see it as more time for skateboarding and playing games.$s#$b#I'm glad that not only has he decided to spend his time helping Gunther, but now is helping Gus as well.",
	"Vincent.CT.ccSam": "Does growing up mean you have to work a lot, farmer @?$3#$b#I don't wanna grow up, then. Sam's gone more now because he's working at the Museum and the big building up close to the mountains.$s",
	
	// Leah cooks on every other Thursday (Post-Aux Event 3)
	
	"Abigail.CT.healthybreakfast": "I like Leah, really, I do. She's probably the one of us girls that understands me the most, outside of Emily.#$b#But that said... health food for breakfast? Give me pancakes slathered in syrup over a muffin any day.$s",
	"Leah.CT.healthybreakfast": "Hey! I'm taking over for breakfast every other Thursday from Gus, since he's holding a cooking class.$h#$b#Drop by then if you want some healthy food for breakfast.",
	"Leah.CT.healthybreakfast.Marriage": "Hey! I'm taking over for breakfast every other Thursday from Gus, since he's holding a cooking class.$h#$b#Don't worry, dear, it'll only be twice a month. The rest of the time, I'm yours.$l",
	"Penny.CT.healthybreakfast": "I'm a little sad I'm missing Leah's healthy breakfasts to learn how to cook, but it's worth it to learn how to create new dishes.$u#$b#I promise, @, Chili de @ will be a dish worthy of the Saloon eventually.",
	"Shane.CT.healthybreakfast": "Ugh, health food for breakfast? I'd rather have dinner for breakfast than health food.$s#$b#Still... I guess I have to set a good example for Jas, and twice a month isn't too bad.$u",
	"Jas.CT.healthybreakfast": "Miss Penny taught us that a balanced breakfast is the most important meal of the day!$4#$b#I hope balanced breakfast doesn't mean vegetables though... Miss Leah seems to like those, and I don't.$3",
	"Pam.CT.healthybreakfast": "Ugh, why am I eating health junk for breakfast sometimes again?$s#$b#Oh, right. Penny gets cooking lessons, and I still get breakfast. Means better food at home *and* some good Saloon grub in the morning.",
	"Pierre.CT.healthybreakfast": "I suppose I should watch what I eat... but I was really hoping the menu would be a bit more varied.$s#$b#I suppose it's for the best. At least Stardrop Breakfast is still open on Thursdays now.",
	"Caroline.CT.healthybreakfast": "Secretly, I hoped Abigail and Leah would become friends - or perhaps more - if only so that she'd adopt some of Leah's healthy habits.$s#$b#I suppose it's not impossible, still, but I'm not sure how I'd get them to connect.$s",
	"Caroline.CT.healthybreakfast.AbigailMarried": "I'm hoping to convince Leah to help me convince Abigail to eat healthier with our weekly Thursday breakfasts.#$b#Would you be willing to help, @? If you did, I'm sure Abigail would at least consider it.",
	
	//Resources Rotting (Post-Wizard Event 1)
	
	"Abigail.CT.resourcerot": "So, @, you know how dad likes to claim credit for your best crops?$u#$b#...what, you didn't think we all knew? We just don't say anything so he doesn't get a bruised ego.#$e#Anyway, it backfired horribly this morning. He took Gus to 'his crops', only to find a few of them were molding.#$b#Gus couldn't pass it up and wondered how 'his crops' were already going bad. Dad couldn't say anything without admitting he was lying about his garden. You should have seen his face.$h",
	"Abigail.CT.resourcerot.Marriage": "So, @, you know how dad likes to claim credit for your best crops?$u#$b#...what, you didn't think we all knew? We just don't say anything so he doesn't get a bruised ego.#$e#Anyway, it backfired horribly last time I visited.#$b#He took Gus to 'his crops', only to find a few of them were molding.

	"Leah.CT.resourcerot": "I've been finding less and less forage in the forest recently. And what I do find seems to rot really quickly.$s#$b#If you've got any spare forage, mind sending some my way? It'd be nicer than picking up stuff from Pierre's.$u",
	"Leah.CT.resourcerot.Marriage": "I've been finding less and less forage in the forest recently. And what I do find seems to rot really quickly.$s#$b#Thankfully we keep a lot of fresh food at home already, so I'm not too worried.$l",
	"Penny.CT.resourcerot": "I was hoping to not have to budget for groceries from Pierre's so soon....$s#$b#...I didn't see you there, @.
