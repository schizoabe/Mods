    //Harvey and Maru
    "HMHeart1.0": "Alright, thanks for coming in Pam. We'll see you next time!",
    "HMHeart1.1": "Thanks Doc. Hopefully not too soon.",
    "HMHeart1.2": "Well that was a pleasant appointment.",
    "HMHeart1.3": "Hmm. Is this really the best way we could have these files organized?",
    "HMHeart1.4": "Is water wet?",
    "HMHeart1.5": "Water is most certainly not wet.",
    "HMHeart1.6": "What? Yes it is.",
    "HMHeart1.7": "No it's not, it wets things but it isn't wet itself.",
    "HMHeart1.8": "It totally is! That's like saying blue paint isn't blue, only the object you're painting is blue.",
    "HMHeart1.9": "Okay fair point, but let me ask you this: is a hotdog a sandwich?$h",
    "HMHeart1.10": "Of course! You may have only the simplest components, meat surrounded by bread, but it's definitely a sandwich.",
    "HMHeart1.11": "I've got one better. If you put a lasagna on top of another lasagna, is it one lasagna or two? ",
    "HMHeart1.12": "It's-",
    "HMHeart1.13": "Alright that one stumped me. I guess it just becomes one really tall lasagna.$h",
    "HMHeart1.14": "Riddle me this: is a vanilla soy latte just a three bean soup?",
    "HMHeart1.15": "How would that be a bean soup?",
    "HMHeart1.16": "Vanilla beans, soybeans, coffee beans... A three bean soup!$h",
    "HMHeart1.17": "Wait, so are all soups just beverages? Or is it the other way around?$h",
    "HMHeart1.18": "Oh, hi there @. I'll help you get checked in. I just need you to fill out these forms.",
    "HMHeart1.19": "Water's not wet!",
    "HMHeart2.0": "Hmm.",
    "HMHeart2.1": "What's up?",
    "HMHeart2.2": "Oh, I was thinking about looking into botany a bit. Our patients ask about herbal remedies pretty often.",
    "HMHeart2.3": "But... A lot of these plant descriptions are getting muddled in my head.",
    "HMHeart2.4": "I can imagine. Maybe @ could help? Or perhaps Harvey.#$b#I'm sure he has to know a thing or two about the plants that grow here.",
    "HMHeart2.5": "I don't think Harvey really has the time.",
    "HMHeart2.6": "I could feel my ears burning. What don't I have time for?",
    "HMHeart2.7": "Going over the medicinal properties of local herbs?",
    "HMHeart2.8": "Well, it's certainly not my specialty, but I did have to take a class about folk medicine.#$b#I come here pretty much every Saturday so...",
    "HMHeart2.9": "If you'd like, we could meet back up and discuss.#$b#You'll have to excuse me if I talk your ear off, though. I tend to get excited about these things!$h",
    "HMHeart2.10": "Don't worry about that. I'd love to.$h#$b#Do you know anything about sweet wormwood?",
    "HMHeart3.0": "It's beautiful out here, isn't it?",
    "HMHeart3.1": "Oh! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.$8",
    "HMHeart3.2": "Sorr- Uh, I'll just be going. Sorry!$2",
    "HMHeart3.3": "No!$2",
    "HMHeart3.4": "What I meant was, no, you don't have to go. I just wasn't expecting someone else to be out here this late.",
    "HMHeart3.5": "Still, I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to frighten you.#$b#It was unexpected for me, too.#$b#I came out here to collect my thoughts, and enjoy the view of the stars. It's a particularly clear night.",
    "HMHeart3.6": "That's why I came out here, too.#$b#You can really see everything tonight.",
    "HMHeart3.7": "I must say, the view is much lovelier than usual.",
    "HMHeart3.8": "Oh?",
    "HMHeart3.9": "Yes. It's not often that I get to enjoy nights like these in the presence of the very definition of beauty. $4",
    "HMHeart3.10": "Oh.$4",
    "HMHeart3.11": "I hope that wasn't too forward.",
    "HMHeart3.12": "No, I simply-",

    "HMEngagement.11": "We should have a big wedding.",
    "HMEngagement.12": "Er, actually we should consider a small intimate one.",
    "HMEngagement.13": "Ugh. For once in my life I don't know!$2",
    "HMEngagement.14": "Come, sweetheart. You don't have to figure it all out alone. Let's all discuss details over dinner.",
