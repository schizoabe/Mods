One day, her mother tells her that they are going to live on their own, just the two of them, and that Lily's father is no longer with them.                              Despite feeling sad, Lily decides to stay positive and make the most of their time together. She loves going to school, playing with her friends, and painting pictures in her room, which she shows her mother. They have many happy moments exploring the city, visiting museums, and trying new foods.      Lily knows that she has a lot of love in her life, and even though she doesn't have a father, she is grateful for all the wonderful things in her life and knows that she can handle anything that comes her way.\"\\playMusic 50s(break)speak Penny \"No need?$0#$b#Okay then.$h\"\\friendship Penny 20/
