  "MaruQuestCompleteLetter": "Hey @,^^Thanks for the fresh manure samples! I'm almost done with my research paper, but to keep things short I've found that the composting process will greatly benefit from a more diverse source of organic materials - basically, add some fishmeal or bonemeal into your Fertilizer or Speed-Gro composting pile respectively, and you'd be surprised with the effects they have on crops!^^If you're interested in the fine details I've attached an excerpt of my paper for you to read at your leisure. Cheers!^^  -Maru",
