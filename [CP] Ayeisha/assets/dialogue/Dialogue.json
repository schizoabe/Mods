@ 	Farmer's name.   Example: Hi there @!
%adj 	Random adjective. (Defined in StringsFromCSFiles.xnb)
%noun 	Random noun. (Defined in StringsFromCSFiles.xnb)
%place 	Random place name. (Defined in StringsFromCSFiles.xnb)
%spouse 	The name of Farmer's spouse.
%name 	A randomly-generated name.
%firstnameletter 	The first half of the farmer's name (rounded down), like Nat if the farmer's name is Natalie.
%time 	Current time.
%band 	The name of Sam and Sebastian's band.
%book 	The title of Elliott's book.
%rival 	A random first name of the Farmer's gender from StringsFromCSFiles.xnb (keys Utility.cs.5499 through Utility.cs.5560). Will not match the Farmer's name.
%pet 	The name of Farmer's pet.
%farm 	Farm name.
%favorite 	The Farmer's favorite thing.
%kid1 	The name of Farmer's first child.
%kid2 	The name of Farmer's second child. 



$q <response IDs> <fallback>#<text> 	Show a dialogue box containing the given question text. If <response IDs> (a list delimited by /) contains an answer already given, the question is skipped (along with the rest of this dialogue line), and instead the dialogue entry identified by <fallback> will be appended to whatever precedes this $q command. The <fallback> dialogue typically uses a $p command to adjust the text based on the player's answer to this question. NOTE: dialogue questions must use unique IDs, similar to events. See the event data page for more information.
$r <response ID> <friendship> <reaction>#<answer text> 	Define a response option to a $q question dialogue. <answer text> is the text shown. <response ID> is used to group responses for future reference (multiple answers can share an answer ID). <friendship> defines the change in friendship value, positive or negative, if this response is selected. <reaction> names the dialogue entry from the NPC's Content\Characters\Dialogue\*.xnb file that will be the NPC's reaction if this response is selected by the player.
$p <response ID>#<match text>|<no-match text> 	Stands for "dialoguePrerequisite". Shows different text depending on whether the player gave a particular answer to a previously-asked question. If <response ID> matches an answer the player gave, <match text> is shown; otherwise, <no-match text> is shown. These texts, separated by |, can each contain multiple commands separated by #. This does not need to be the first command in the dialogue string.
$b 	Indicates pauses in dialogue, where the player will need to click for the next part to load in a new dialogue box.
$e 	Ends the current dialogue, closing the dialogue box and resuming player control. The dialogue following $e will require a new interaction with the NPC.
$k 	TODO. Stands for "dialogueKill".
$c <probability>#<text1>#<text2> 	Show <text1> with a <probability> between 0 and 1; otherwise, show <text2>. E.g. $c 0.9 for a 90% chance of <text1> and a 10% chance of <text2>. NOTE: Replacer commands (see below) do not work in <text1>. This does not need to be the first command in a dialogue string. It is unaffected by daily luck.
$d <bus|joja|cc> 	dialogueDependingOnWorldState "Tue4": "$d <dependence>#|Dialogue when dependence value is true.|Dialogue in other situations.",
The dependence can take one of three values: "bus": is the bus fixed?; "joja": is JoJa Mart in business?; "cc": has the Community Centre been completed? This command must start the dialogue string and does not allow for any other dialogue commands in the string.
$y 	TODO. Stands for "dialogueQuickResponse"; A simpler form of question. Works like $q, but within one and the same text line. It doesn't have neither "dialoguePrerequisite" ($p) nor friendship point changes. It can be triggered indenitelly.
Example: Penny: "$y 'Breakfast?_Yes please._Here you go._No, I'm good_More for me then!'"
$1 <letter ID>#<1st-time text> #$e# <nth-time text> 	Creates a line of dialogue which the character will only see once (at most). <1st-time text> is shown only if <letter ID> has not been marked as sent yet (and this marks it as sent); otherwise, <nth-time text> is shown. <letter ID> should not correspond to an actual piece of mail (because it will not be sent), but it can be referenced by events or other dialogue lines.
%fork 	Sets the the specialEventVariable1 variable, which can be checked by a later fork event command. Mainly useful in reaction dialogue for $q questions during events.
[# # #] 	Gives the player a random item, from the pool 


$h 	Switch the speaking character to their happy portrait.
$s 	Switch the speaking character to their sad portrait.
$u 	Switch the speaking character to their unique portrait.
$l 	Switch the speaking character to their love portrait.
$a 	Switch the speaking character to their angry portrait. 


% 	Turns the dialogue box into a generic text box.
Example: "%Abigail is lost in her music."
