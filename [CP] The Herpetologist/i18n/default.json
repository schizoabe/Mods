// 2 HEARTS SUMMER

"Core.Nora.Summer.Mon.2h": "It's almost time to feed Pinkie Pie again!$1#$b#You see, snakes can actually expand their mouths and swallow their preys whole.#$b#That means it takes a long time for them to digest anything they eat.$4#$b#So there's usually a big gap between their meals.#$b#Can you imagine? Having lunch now and then only having it again 2 months or so.$3#$b#Fascinating!$1",
"Core.Nora.Summer.Tue.2h": "%Nora signs that she's having a hearing break. She wishes you have a great day!",

"Core.Nora.Fall.Sun.2h": "I think I might've had instant noodles for lunch way too many times this month to be considered healthy...$2#$b#Well, in my defense, I'm not a great cook. And I don't have a lot of time to cook.#$b#But I guess I should order something in from time to time.$1",

// 2 HEARTS WINTER

"Core.Nora.Winter.Mon.2h": "I don't think I'm gonna see any purple-tailed chameleons this season.#$b#It is far too cold and dry for them. I bet they're probably cuddling up somewhere cozy.$1#$b#Well, I hope they are anyways. Otherwise, they're in a bad position.$3",

"Core.Nora.Summer.Mon.4h": "Ah, I'm so tired today...$2#$b#Stupid is going through his shedding. It's a delicate process so sometimes I'd rather stay up with him.#$b#Reptiles need to shed their skin from time to time because, if their bodies grow, the skin doesn't.
