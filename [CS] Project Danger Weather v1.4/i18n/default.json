"BuildStationMessage1.Modified": "A handy book on weather effects and farming.^The notes inside are the result of parsed data from the station's computer.#In short, with this station crops are more resistant to harsh weather, reducing losses by about half.^Beneficial weather effects are slightly enhanced.^^Such benefits extend to areas where crops have been planted.",
"Wizard.Array.LetterText.Modified": "Greetings,^^I am aware of the difficulties your farm may have had over the harsh weather conditions the Valley possess.^As I have researched on the elementals that inhabit this land, it has come to my attention how rich in mana your farm is.^I have devised an array of protection for you. Although it is costly due to its power, I believe it to be in your best interests.^^      -M. Rasmodius^^^^An additional note:^The array can only be built once, and its power only protects the valley. I may try to develop another array in the future.",
"MudRain.Soil.LetterText.Modified": "^^Dear farmer,^^This muddy rain contains high amounts of nutrients for crops! Making the soil gain such important nutrients. If you experience sudden crop growth, then this could be the reason. Sadly, the soil will gradually lose this boost of nutrients...^Don't forget to keep your crops happy and flourishing.^                 -Ferngill's WCD Center",
