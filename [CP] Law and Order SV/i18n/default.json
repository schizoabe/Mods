    "Events.239790004.qqq":"Maybe I should say something...",
    "Events.239790004.qq1":"Shannon is right, you should be more careful.",
    "Events.239790004.qq2":"I walk into people's living areas when they're not home all the time. It's normal.",

    "Events.239790006.010":"When I asked you to come into the sheriff's office before... I wasn't being very kind. I was hoping we could start over.",
    "Events.239790006.011":"So, I want to give you something to demonstrate my sincerity...#$b#I know the winters can be quite cold here, so I made you this blanket... I hope you'll accept it.",
    "Events.239790006.012":"Emily helped me select natural dyes, so it's safe to wash in the lake, and you're welcome to come into the sheriff's office and dry it by the fire.",
    "Events.239790006.013":"Miss Shannon... this is a very fine gift. Thank you very much. Please tell Miss Emily I'm grateful to her as well. I'll treasure this.",

    "Events.239790008.013":"Yes, sir!",
    "Events.239790008.014":"Sheriff, I just got off the phone with Penny. She doesn't know where Vincent is, just mentioned that he was quite excited in class today when they were talking about minerals, especially when Penny mentioned she loved emeralds.",
    "Events.239790008.015":"That reminds me, Vincent asked me today where emeralds come from... I...",
    "Events.239790008.015b":"Oh no! Do you think he went to the mines!?$4",
    "Events.239790008.016":"Oh my!!",
    "Events.239790008.017":"How could I be so stupid...$s",

    "Events.239790008.025":"Dad, I'm going. So just get over it.$a",
    "Events.239790008.026":"Mayor Lewis will arrange for Doctor Harvey to be on hand, in case anyone is in need of medical attention.",
    "Events.239790008.027":"Gus, please remain here to update the others if they call or return.",
    "Events.239790008.027b":"Sure thing, Sheriff",
    "Events.239790008.028":"Everyone else, you can remain here, join Mayor Lewis at the mine entrance, or be on the lookout in town.",
    "Events.239790008.029":"Or... head to the shrine of Yoba at Pierre's. We'll need all the help we can get...",
    "Events.239790008.030":"Let's move.",
    
    "Events.239790008.031":"Stay safe everyone.",
    "Events.239790008.032":"This way.",

    "Events.239790008.046":"Vincent!!",
    "Events.239790008.047":"Vincent! Are you hurt? Where have you been!?$4",
    "Events.239790008.048":"Mom, Dad... I'm sorry...$s",
    "Events.239790008.049":"Vincent crossed my path in the mountains and told me he was on his way to find an emerald... I told him the mines were no place for a young man his age.#$b#I suggested it would be safer to look in the quarry and walked there with him.#$b#I'm sorry, I didn't know everyone was looking for him...$s",
    "Events.239790008.050":"Linus, you have nothing to be sorry about. You kept my son safe... you may have saved his life. Thank you.$h",
    "Events.239790008.051":"And Russell, Shannon... everyone... thank you for looking after my family.$h",
    "Events.239790008.052":"Vincent, straight to bed now. We'll talk about this more tomorrow.$2#$b#Everyone else... drinks are on me.$h",
    "Events.239790008.053":"OK, Dad... I just wish after all that I could have found an emerald for Miss Penny...$s#$b#All I could find was this.$s",

    "Events.Shannon14H.qqa1r":"Sure, but it's a beautiful mess.#$b#Just like me!$9",
    "Events.Shannon14H.qqa2":"We worked hard to make this a beautiful place to build a life together.",

    "Events.Shannon14H.004":"Hey. I was thinking...",
    "Events.Shannon14H.005":"Maybe I could use a change, too?",
    "Events.Shannon14H.qqbq":"I was thinking of trying a new hair color. What do you think?",

Even cooked items will stay fresh day after day.",
    "Events.RipleyWizard.006":"That's partly the natural magic of this valley, and partly because... I tampered with that magic... and failed to anticipate the consequences.#$b#I created an unstable imbalance in the magical forces of growth and decay, and a sort of 'husk' was created as a byproduct of the spell.#$b#Everything in its vicinity would rapidly decay, and it attracted monsters of every kind from the mines and other dark abodes.",

Whether {{cfgRipley}} was drawn to the husk, I don't know...#$b#but {{cfgRipley}} became the keeper of those woods. I placed wards at the pass to contain the monsters. {{cfgRipley}} may have also been affected...",

    "Events.RipleyWizard.010":"I have learned much since then. The magic of the forest is vast, but it must be gently persuaded. Its power can not be commanded by force.#$b#... If you maintain a discourse with that spirit, I hope you will convey my regrets.",
    "Events.RipleyWizard.011":"Convey them yourself, you coward!!",
    "Events.RipleyWizard.012":"That's a bit of magic I picked up from your ex. I'm not sure what you did to get on her bad side, but keep it up.#$b#Perhaps you were hoping to make amends one day, and that's why you left your warp point unsecured? How pathetic.",
    "Events.RipleyWizard.012b":"The transformation will wear off tomorrow. Probably.#$b#In any case that felt very therapeutic.",
    "Events.RipleyWizard.013":"It's true, I'm no longer a prisoner of the Ghostwoods... but as you can see I still have little patience for humans.#$b#Most of them anyway.#$b#Well... you know where to find me.",

    "Events.SawRipleyWizard.Wizard":"Thankfully, the transformation was temporary. I have no intention to retaliate... I know better than to wage a pointless war with an ancient disgruntled spirit.#$e#I should call her...",
