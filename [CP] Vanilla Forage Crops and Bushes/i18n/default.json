However, I didn't know how many other animals really love cave carrots too!^^Of course, I can't just ask for your help whenever I need a cave carrot, so ordered in some seeds, both for myself and for my stock. It's much easier to grow them yourself then having to forage in the mines, isn't it? If you ever want to give your animals a treat, see if cave carrots are a favorite.^^See you around!^-Marnie",
