## FULL EVENT LIST FOR KANTRIP'S MARRY ME: REVERSE PROPOSALS MOD ##

### WHITE EVENTS
ALL of the white proposal events have the following conditions:
* Must be dating the NPC
* Must be at 10 hearts with the NPC
* Must have seen the 10 heart event for the NPC (does not apply to modded NPCs)
* Must have at least one free slot in the player's inventory for the mermaid pendant
* Weather must be SUNNY (except for Harvey)
* Must have not seen the BLACK proposal event for that suitor
* Player must not be married or engaged to anyone else

About half of the vanilla suitors will also require an invitation letter. Start checking your mailbox on sunny days after seeing the 10 heart event for that suitor.

The rest don't require an invitation, but they won't trigger until after the 10 heart event has been seen.

NOTE: If RANDOM TIMING is turned ON, seeing the 10 heart event for that bachelor will trigger a 14-28 day delay before the proposal. If you turn random timing OFF at any point during that period, the proposal will fire the next day. (Suitors requiring a letter will take one additional day).
