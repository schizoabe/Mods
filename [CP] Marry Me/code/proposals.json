//Standard events for the 12 vanilla bachelors/bachelorettes
//Load individually to try and keep from loading in a bunch of unnecessary assets

//Preconditions:
    //Dating
    //At 10 hearts
    //Must have seen that suitor's 10 heart event

//Effects:
    //Will set the black version of this event as seen for that suitor, without setting the "SeenBlackEvent" flag
    //If YES: engagement occurs, with marriage in 3 days' time
    //If NO:
        // I'm not ready: dialogue. No effect
        // I never want to get married: dialogue. No effect
        // I don't want to get married... to you: player loses 4 hearts with the suitor and they break up (no longer dating)
