  "ElliottReaction.Hospital": "My dearest @,^^Dr. Harvey contacted me yesterday to ask for surgical consent on your behalf while you were unresponsive, and has since updated me on your condition. I was ready to cancel my tour and return home at once, although he assured me that you would be fine.^Truly, darling, I was frightened for you, but all I can do from so far away is ask you to be careful.^I miss you and wish I could have been with you when you needed me the most.^^All my love, your devoted husband Elliott.[#]A Very Worried Husband",

I will have a lot of doting to catch up on once I return home.^^Be safe, and I shall see you soon, darling.^-Love, Elliott[#]A Worried Husband",

	"PlayerKilled.doctor.05": "Since you were unconscious and unable to consent to the surgery, I had to call your husband to explain the situation and get his consent instead.#$b#He was very worried for you, of course. #$b#Even said he would cancel his tour and return to Stardew Valley, although he agreed to hold off on that when I updated him on your condition after the surgery.",
  "PlayerKilled.doctor.06": "Your condition is much better now, @, but please be more careful next time.$2",

I just wanted to see that you were going to pull through before I left.$7#$b#I heard gossip that you'd been seriously hurt, and before I knew it, I was here. I guess I just didn't want you to wake up alone after all that.$2",
  "PlayerKilled.Haley.22": "You may be my ex, but I don't hate you. I can't hate the person from my dearest memories, even if you're not that person for me anymore.$2#$b#It would just have really sucked if you woke up thinking that no one cares what happens to you anymore.$2#$b#... That's all I have for you. Bye, @.$2",

  "MineKilled.Haley.01": "There you are, @. Can you stand up? Your clothes are getting all muddy.$7",

	"MineKilled.Haley.04": "Well, yeah. I wouldn't have gone there myself. I knew I'd only get in the way, and on top of that, my shoes would be ruined.$4#$b#It wasn't compassion. Giving it my all is just my duty as @'s wife.$4",

	"PlayerKilled.Leah.20": "I won't take up much time, I promise. These days, I don't have much to say to @ anyway.$3",
  "PlayerKilled.Leah.21": "So. It's good to see you up and out of bed already.$3#$b#I guess I should've known that you'd shrug something like this right off.$3#$b#I came to sit with you after your surgery because I figured that no one deserves to wake up by themselves after something so scary. That's all.$2",
  "PlayerKilled.Leah.22": "I'm moving on, @, but that doesn't mean I'd ever wish you harm. You nearly died, and I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.$2#$b#And whether or not you actually wanted me to come... Well, that's something I don't ever want to find out.$2#$b#... Don't tell me. I don't know which answer I would hate more. Bye, @.$2",

	"MineKilled.Leah.04": "Oh! Thanks... You don't have to make me feel better about staying behind. I just did what I had to do for the one I love.$4",
	"MineKilled.Leah.07": "So... Are you heading back home, @? I know you're tough, but I think you've deserved your rest for today.#$b#If you want, you can even tell me what happened down there.

  "PlayerKilled.Maru.08": "Well, you heard him. You have to be more careful out there, doctor's orders.$3#$b#We should go home. At least you can say you have your own personal nurse to take care of you!$1",
	"PlayerKilled.Maru.09": "But in all seriousness, please don't get hurt anymore. Watching you slip right through my fingers... I never want to go through that ever again.$2",
  "PlayerKilled.Maru.20": "I know the rules, Harvey. It's nice of you to worry about me, too, though. You don't have to.$8",
  "PlayerKilled.Maru.21": "Wow. Harvey really put you back together in one piece, huh?$8#$b#Oh, that... that hurt. Sorry. That was probably a little too familiar of me.$8#$b#...Look, I just came to make sure that you'd be okay after the surgery. You rolled in here hanging on by a thread, so...$2",
  "PlayerKilled.Maru.22": "It was bad, @. I didn't assist in the surgery, but I know it wasn't an easy one. Whatever happened to you out there almost got you for good.$2#$b#And... personally, I wouldn't have wanted to wake up alone from something so scary all by myself, so I stayed. Just in case you felt the same way.$2#$b#It doesn't mean that anything's changed between us. All it means is that I'm not a robot. My heart doesn't get an off-switch.$2",

  "MineKilled.Maru.01": "Hey, you're awake! Good. I was worried for a second that I'd have to call Harvey for help.",
	"MineKilled.Maru.02": "Something knocked you out in the mines, dear. That bump on your head says it got you good, too.$2#$b#You were gone a little too long, so I ventured in to check on you. I had a feeling something was up.$2",
	"MineKilled.Maru.04": "You think so? I go in there to study geological formations all the time, but I've never gone so deep before.$4#$b#I only went in because I knew you'd have my back. Nothing to do with bravery, if you ask me.$4",
	"MineKilled.Maru.07": "Alright, we should leave. I'll take a look at you when we get home, just to be sure you're not too badly hurt.#$b#Everything else aside, though, I'm glad you're alright, @.

I just wanted to be sure that you'd be okay before I left.$3#$b#Just because we're not together anymore, it doesn't mean I wouldn't care about what happens to you.$2#$b#As relieved as I am, though... Seeing you again hurts more than I thought it would. I should go.$2",
  "PlayerKilled.Penny.22": "Truth is, I just didn't want you to wake up after going through something so difficult all by yourself.$2#$b#No one should have to feel abandoned after coming so close to losing their life.$2#$b#That being said, I should think of myself, too. Being here hurts too much, so... I'll leave you to it. Be well, @. Goodbye.$2",

	"MineKilled.Alex.04": "Oh, it's nothing. Punching a slime here and there isn't much of a workout, though I totally see how easy it is to get overwhelmed.$4#$b#I guess I'm only courageous when I got someone at my back to prevent that from happening.",
