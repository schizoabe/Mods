    "Penny.flowerdance.mature.y2": "You know, according to old valley folklore, this dance used to be... well, a bit more rustic.$7#$b#It involved a lot more wild berries and a lot less clothing.$l#$b#...Just some trivia from a book I was reading! Don't look at me like that!$h",

    "Penny.flowerdance.y4": "To be honest, the best part of this festival for me is going home with you afterwards.$l#$b#The quiet walk back to the farm, the smell of spring blossoms in the air... and knowing I get to fall asleep in your arms.$l#$b#Let's not stay too late, okay?",
    "Penny.flowerdance.mature.y4": "Sam just reminded me how I used to blush through this whole festival...$7#$b#I'm not that shy girl anymore, thanks to you, @.$7#$b#Which reminds me... you know the waterfall by the path as you enter the meadow?#$b#When I was younger, I'd hide behind it during the Flower Dance, pretending I was a fairy princess waiting for my knight...$l#$b#What do you say we slip away later, just the two of us?$l#$b#I want to show you how the mist catches the sunlight... and maybe steal a kiss or... more.$l",
