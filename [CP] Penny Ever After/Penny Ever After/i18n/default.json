'One Hundred and One Ways to Cook Melon'... should I get it?$7#$b#I know I'm not the best cook, but maybe this is the key to unlocking my hidden culinary talents.$h#$b#...Or maybe we'll just end up with one hundred and one interesting kitchen disasters.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.5": "Honey! I bumped into Emily in the square, and she invited us for dinner Friday night.$h#$b#I said yes because... well, you know how persistent she can be!#$b#Last time she made that 'special tea' I had the strangest dreams... I was floating through the mines with a magical sword!$h",
    "Pennyinstore.6": "I was just talking to Abigail when Sebastian came in. You should have seen how they looked at each other!$h#$b#I think there's a romance brewing there... reminds me of how nervous I used to get around you.$l#$b#Well, I still do sometimes. Especially when you wear that shirt that shows off your... um... farmerly attributes.$l",

    "Pennyinstore.9": "I saw these flower seeds and thought of that spot behind the house.

    "Pennyinstore.12": "Pierre's new 'Artisanal Fertilizer' is just regular fertilizer in a fancy bag. Don't fall for it, dear.$h#$b#Though I do love how your eyes light up whenever you spot new farming supplies.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.13": "Morning, sweetheart! Fancy meeting you here. I was just picking up some tea leaves.#$b#I thought we could have a proper tea ceremony tonight?#$b#I've been reading about the traditional Gotoro style... it involves a lot of sitting still and contemplating existence.#$b#Or we could just drink tea in bed while I read to you. Your choice!$7",
    "Pennyinstore.14": "I'm picking up ingredients for dinner tonight. How does 'Experimental Pepper Poppers à la Penny' sound?$h#$b#Okay, okay... maybe I'll follow an actual recipe this time. We can't have another 'Great Kitchen Fire of Spring 4' incident.$u",
    "Pennyinstore.15": "Abigail just stormed out of here after another argument with Pierre about her hair color.$s#$b#I overheard him suggesting she try 'a nice natural brown' for the next Flower Dance...$u#$b#Some parents never learn when to stop pushing, do they?",
    "Pennyinstore.16": "I love how Pierre rearranges everything every week. It's like a treasure hunt!$7#$b#Though I'm starting to suspect he does it just to make us wander past the expensive imported goods...#$b#Nice try, Pierre, but I have a budget! Well... mostly. Don't look in my basket.$u",
    "Pennyinstore.17": "Oh, you're just in time to help me carry things!$h#$b#What? I can't help it if my eyes are bigger than my arms when it comes to books and baking supplies...$h#$b#Besides, those farm muscles of yours need a different kind of workout sometimes.$l",

    "Pennyinstore.22": "Do you ever think about that first time we ran into each other here?#$b#I was pretending to browse produce while watching you out of the corner of my eye...$l#$b#You smiled at me and my knees almost gave out.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.23": "Pierre keeps glancing at us like he expects us to start kissing in the produce aisle...$h#$b#Which is tempting, but I'd rather tease him by almost but not quite touching you all through the store.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.24": "Sweetheart! I was hoping I'd run into you.$l#$b#%Penny glances around to make sure no one's watching, then pulls you behind a shelf for a quick kiss.#$b#Mmm... I've been wanting to do that all morning. You taste like blackberry cobbler.$h#$b#Have you been sneaking dessert for breakfast again?$7",

    "Pennyinstore.26": "I overheard Pierre and Caroline arguing about their daughter's 'unusual diet' again.$h#$b#I still can't believe we actually witnessed Abigail eat that quartz crystal at the last Luau. I thought Mayor Lewis was going to faint!$h#$b#It did look a bit like rock candy, though...",
    "Pennyinstore.27": "Mmm, look at you - all windswept and glowing.$l#$b#...And Pierre's glaring because I'm blatantly ogling you instead of browsing his overpriced preserves.$h",
    "Pennyinstore.28": "Do you know how many romance novels use 'accidental shopping encounters' as meet-cutes?$h#$b#Not that I need fiction when my husband looks at me like... mmm, like that.$l^Not that I need fiction when my wife looks at me like... mmm, like that.$l#$b#%Penny tugs you into the shadows between the shelves, pressing a fleeting, sugar-sweet kiss to your lips.",
    "Pennyinstore.29": "You look so... capable right now. All dirty from the fields, sleeves rolled up...$l#$b#Pierre keeps side-eyeing us. Should we give him a scandal to gossip about? Maybe a quick kiss by the seed display?$h",
    "Pennyinstore.30": "Mmm, I love bumping into you on my day off like this. It's like a little surprise date!$h#$b#Want to wander around town with me for a bit after this? Maybe we could have a picnic under my favorite tree...$l",

    "Pennyinstore.mature.2": "You caught me, @...$l#$b#%Penny hides a small jar behind her back.#$b#I was buying ingredients for that... *special* dessert you like. The one where I drip honey all over you and—$l#$b#Oh! *Ahem*... Never mind, Pierre's staring.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.3": "Mmm... Your shirt is rolled up at the sleeves, and there's dirt on your forearms.$l#$b#I might need to drag you behind the community center for a quick inspection of those muscles.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.4": "I'm picking up a new nightgown from Emily's after this. I think you'll like it... Though, if history repeats itself, it won't stay on long.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.5": "*soft sigh* The way your shirt clings to your back when you're sweaty should be illegal.$l#$b#Pierre would ban us from the store forever if I did want I'm currently fantasizing about doing to you in the spice aisle.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.6": "I bought whipped cream... for baking. Definitely just for baking.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.7": "This new recipe calls for... 'long, firm zucchinis'.#$b#I'm trying very hard to be mature about this.$h#$b#...Mostly because I plan to be very immature about it later.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.8": "Oh, honey, your shirt's half-unbuttoned... Did you rush here straight from the fields?$h#$b#Now everyone in town knows how gorgeous your collarbone is. I should be jealous... but I just want to kiss it.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.9": "You look tired, love. I hope you're not overworking yourself again.$u#$b#I added extra chocolate to my basket to help your energy levels. And because you make the cutest noises when I feed it to you in bed.$l",

It's making me wish we were back home in bed right now.$l#$b#%Penny blushes and glances around furtively before pulling you close.#$b#I can't stop thinking about how you touched me last night...$l#$b#I want more of that tonight, okay? I'll make us a quick dinner so we have plenty of time...$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.13": "*giggles* Oh my, Caroline is really laying into Abigail about her messy room. I guess some things never change, even when your daughter's an adult.#$b#Speaking of messy... I still need to tidy up our bedroom after last night's 'activities'.$l#$b#I swear, you toss my clothes around like confetti when we make love!$h",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.14": "Goodness, Pierre's new wallpaper selection is... interesting.$h#$b#%Penny points to a garish pattern with bright pink flamingos.#$b#Can you imagine our bedroom with that? We'd never get any sleep!$h#$b#Although... we don't get much sleep anyway, do we?$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.15": "Hi, sweetheart! I'm debating between green tea or chamomile for our evening ritual...$7#$b#The chamomile might help you relax after farming all day, but the green tea might keep us awake longer for... other activities.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.16": "I'm choosing some new flooring... but all I can think about is how you pinned me to the bedroom rug yesterday.$l#$b#Hardwood or tile, honey? Either way, we'll test its durability tonight.$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.17": "Abigail just asked me why I 'smile so much' in here.$7#$b#I told her 'Pierre stocks good jam'.$h#$b#But really... it's because I keep replaying that thing you did with your tongue last night...$l",
    "Pennyinstore.mature.18": "Oh, hi honey. I didn't expect to see you here. Guess what? Jodi just complimented my outfit.$h#$b#I almost said, 'My husband likes me in skirts - easier access.'$l^I almost said, 'My wife likes me in skirts - easier access.'$l#$b#But, um... decorum prevailed, thankfully.$l",

    "Pennyinstore2.13": "I know it's silly, but I still budget carefully like I did in the trailer.$u#$b#Old habits die hard, I suppose. I just added up our groceries three times to make sure we could afford them...",
    "Pennyinstore2.14": "Did you see Abigail earlier? She was carrying four pumpkins and a crystal ball.$h#$b#She whispered something about a 'midnight summoning ritual' to Pierre, and his face turned absolutely white!#$b#Sometimes I think she just enjoys tormenting her poor father.$h",
