    "Alchemistry_22743111.Dialogue.002": "Remember: alchemy is a marriage between magic and science.$0#$b#In this case, a Transmuter Coil leans heavily on the sciences to empower an alchemist's work. It is quite possibly our most powerful machination for transmutation.$0#$b#The device consists of a glass tube, filled with an arcane substrate where you place your reagents.

    "Alchemistry_22743111.Dialogue.003": "So... It's like a stronger Essence Restabilizer?", // Farmer
    "Alchemistry_22743111.Dialogue.004": "Yes and no.$0#$b#An Essence Restabilizer is indeed a type of transmuter, but its abilities do not go beyond the creation of Ectoplasm. It simply does not generate enough energy.", // Wizard

Perhaps.$0#$b#Many alchemists have been attempting to create the Stone for centuries. None have succeeded... yet.$0#$b#But, the ability to craft enchanted gems is something that all alchemists learn to do. This can only be accomplished with a device as powerful as a Transmuter Coil.$0", // Wizard
