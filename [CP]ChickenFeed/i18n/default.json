  "MarnieCoopHint": "Dear @,^^Congratulations on your new coop! You're on your way to raising some wonderful chickens and collect their eggs - just come over and I can sell you some baby chicks to get started!^^Chickens (and most coop animals) are very self-sufficient, and if you let them outside they can dig for worms and seeds all by themselves. They do prefer foraging in tall grass though, so you should plant some around your coop if you can. If they have to stay inside, you can make poultry feed by milling corn and mixed seeds - or you can buy them from me if you have money to spare.^^Oh, and last but not least, make sure to pet them every day! Animals need love too, not just food.^   -Marnie[#]Marnie's Coop Tips",
  "MarnieBarnHint": "Dear @,^^I heard you have built a barn on your farm - if you need some livestock, I can sell you baby cows to get you started!^^Taking care of cows and livestock is not as hard as it sounds - make sure to pet them (this is important!) and feed them every day either with fresh grass, or hay if they don't feel like going outside. You can buy hay from me, or scythe down some grass to collect hay yourself if you have a silo. Once your cows are of age, you can milk them with a Milk Pail for their oh-so-delicious milk. That's all, and good luck!^   -Marnie[#]Marnie's Barn Tips",
  "MarnieFreeMill.title": "Marnie's Old Mill",
  "MarnieFreeMill": "Dear @,^^You have been raising chickens on your farm for a while now, and you're probably thinking of making your own poultry feed, huh? You'll need to commission Robin to build a mill on your farm, but if you don't have the materials yet, you can use this old hand mill of mine to get started. It's not as good as the real deal, but it should be fine for processing small volumes of items.^   -Marnie",
  "MarnieQuestCompleteLetter.title": "Marnie's Secret Recipes",
  "MarnieQuestCompleteLetter": "Dear @,^^Once again, thank you so much for indulging this old lady's request. My dear animals are a little happier these days, and for that I'm ever grateful.^^As thanks, I've attached to this letter my family recipes that I use to make my own hay and feed; they do take a bit of extra effort and farm produce, but they are so much more filling than scythed grass or milled corn.^   -Marnie",
  "QiAnimalCrackerRecipe": "Quite the rancher you've become, kid. I'm selling my recipe for a certain item you may find useful - expect to have to work for it though.^   -Qi",
