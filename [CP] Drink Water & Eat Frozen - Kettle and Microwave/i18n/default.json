It has its own little burner, and it's welded shut to it! Looks like you might need coal and some way to check if it's still working... Then perhaps you could buy some instant coffee and try making a cup?^Let me know how it goes.     - Mom",

Your Uncle Leo gave it to us as a wedding gift actually, many years ago.^He made a few of those, I think, before the company closed down and he moved away somewhere. You probably don't remember him, and it's fine, I couldn't tell you whose brother or husband is he exactly. Your Grandpa was the one to keep track.^Anyway, this guy left some blueprints for the family, should we ever need them. Seems like this one should come in handy for you now!^You should be able to make some decent coffee and tea with it.       - Dad"
