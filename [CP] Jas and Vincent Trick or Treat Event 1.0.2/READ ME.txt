How to install the mod: 
1. Download mod folder
2. Unzip the file if it downloaded as a .zip file
3. If you have a Mac, open a finder window and navigate to here: ~Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Stardew Valley/Contents/ 
4. If you have a PC or need more info https://savelocation.net/stardew-valley 
5. Place whatever version of the Trick Or Treat mod you downloaded into the “Mods” folder
6. Make sure you have SMAPI installed on your computer (I use nexusmods.com but you can also just google SMAPI)
7. Make sure you have required mods for it (currently, just Content Patcher) if not, download off of Nexus and put it in the same "Mods" folder
8. Launch the game through Steam and SMAPI should run Terminal at the same time - if it doesn’t, make sure it’s installed correctly. 


Hi! This is my first time publishing a mod. It's a little trick-or-treat event that can occur any Fall Sunday on the farm. I made it for the SDV Halloween event in 2024.
