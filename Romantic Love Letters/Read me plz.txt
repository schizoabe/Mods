Thank you for downloading my mods, and I'll show you how to trigger these favorability-linked emails (or letters, however you like)
In general, I divide the relationship stages of a single NPC into four types: close friendship, crush, love while dating, and engagement (and divorce). Literary NPCs will send you more love letters (about forty or so), while NPCs that are not very expressive in setting send you fewer love letters (about twenty to thirty). The intimacy of these love letters is related to likability and will present different content depending on the season.
In addition, NPCs with high favorability will send you invitations the day before certain festivals they like, such as the day before the Flower Dance Festival, where they will invite you to become their dance partner. Some of them will also give you gifts in the form of packages, and of course some NPCs don't like to give you gifts, which varies from person to person.
May your joy be with Stardew Valley.

衷心感谢您下载我的模组，我将为您讲解如何触发这些跟好感度挂钩的邮件（或者信件，按照您的喜好）。
大体上我把一个单身NPC的感情阶段分为四种：亲密的友情、暗恋、约会时的热恋、订婚（与离婚）。具有文学性色彩的NPC会给您寄去更多的情书（大约四十多封），而在设定上并不很擅长表达的NPC给您寄出的情书则比较少（大约在二十到三十封）。这些情书的亲昵度与好感度相关，并且会因为季节不同呈现不同的内容。
除此之外，好感度比较高的NPC会在某些他们喜欢的节日的前一天给您寄去邀请信，比如在花舞节的前一天，他们会在信里邀请您成为他们的舞伴。他们中的有些NPC也会以包裹的形式给您送礼物，当然也有些NPC不喜欢给您送礼物，因人而异。
愿您的欢愉与星露谷永远同在。
