If you do not have enough mana for a spell cast, the spell will fail.^^You will regenerate mana overtime, but you may often encounter situations were you need to replenish mana quickly. There are items that you can make to help you with this.^^I am providing a recipe for a cake you can make that replenishes a bit of mana. The Adventurer's guild and the Saloon will now also sell recipes to make mana items that will help replenish more mana.^^Good luck on your magic endeavors. ^-M. Rasmodius, Wizard"
