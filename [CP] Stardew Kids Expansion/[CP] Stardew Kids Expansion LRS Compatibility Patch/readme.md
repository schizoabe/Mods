# [CP] Stardew Kids Expansion LRS Compatibility Patch

This mod overrides the schedule changes made by LRS that cause serious bugs with newer versions of Stardew Kids Expansion.

## Installation

Place the patch in your Data/Mods folder or use a mod manager.

**WARNING**:
The mod will still run and make changes even if you do not have either version of LRS installed, this was done due to the complexity of making a hard requirement with an 'or' logic that I honestly didn't want to deal with.  
*Ensure that you have a version of Little Red Schoolhouse installed or it will break the kids' schedules!*

## Usage Instructions

Enable the 'SKE Edits' config option in LRS to have the kids present at the Egg Hunt festival, and Tina present at the Flower Dance and Stardew Valley Fair.
