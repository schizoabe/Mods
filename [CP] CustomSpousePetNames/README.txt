To customize the pet names and stardrop dialogue for your spouse:

1. Open the content.json file with any text editing program like Notepad or Notepad++

2. After every line that starts with "NPC.cs", there is the default pet name associated with that string, which can be changed to whatever you'd like!

3. "NPC.cs.4001" is the stardrop dialogue - once again, I've left the default in for reference, and you're free to change it to whatever you'd like. 

The stardrop dialogue changes can be switched on and off in the config.json. This is so if you're using other dialogue mods that edit the stardrop dialogue, such as Immersive Character - Shane, there won't be any conflicts.
