FV = Friendship Value
RV = Resentment Value
OV = Optimization Value (Can be ignored if not using Optimization.

Friendship Values
01 = 2 heart standard
02 = 4 heart standard
03 = 6 heart standard
04 = 8 heart standard
05 = 10 heart standard
06 = 12 heart standard
07 = 14 heart standard
22 = Dating standard
23 = Married standard

08-14+24/25 is the low variant
15-21+16/17 is the high variant

Yes, the numbering is a little confusing. Yes, I regret doing it that way. Yes, it is WAY too late to fix it.

Most bonuses are standard. Low bonuses are used for bonuses where, for various reasons, I felt that a standard bonus would be too much. High bonuses are used VERY sparingly.

Resentment Values

01 = Dating standard
02 = Married standard
03 = 12-heart standard
04 = 14-heart standard

05-08 is the high variant
09-12 is the low variant
13 is for 2-10 hearts. It is labeled as a low variant, but all instances of 2-10 hearts uses this value.

Optimization Values
01 = 2-8 heart standard bonuses added together
02 = 2-8 heart low bonuses added together
03 = 2-8 heart high bonuses added together
04 = 2-8 heart resentment values added together (In this case, that just means RV13 x 4)
