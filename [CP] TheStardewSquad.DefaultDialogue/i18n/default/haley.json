  "dialogue.friendship_too_low.haley.1": "Hang out with... you? All day? Um, I think I'm busy. Yeah. Definitely busy.",
  "dialogue.friendship_too_low.haley.2": "Sorry, but I only go on 'adventures' with my actual friends.",
  "dialogue.friendship_too_low.haley.3": "That's a nice thought, but... no. Not right now.",
  "dialogue.friendship_too_low.haley.4": "I don't really know you that well. It would be kind of awkward, don't you think?",
  "dialogue.friendship_too_low.haley.5": "Maybe if you got some new clothes first. The ones you're wearing are... not it.",

  // ==========================================
  // --- LOW FRIENDSHIP (< 6 HEARTS) ---
  // ==========================================

  "dialogue.recruit.haley.low_hearts.1": "You want me... to follow you around? Ugh, fine. But only if we don't get my clothes dirty.",
  "dialogue.recruit.haley.low_hearts.2": "Seriously? You want me to tag along? I guess. But if I see a single bug, I'm out.",
  "dialogue.recruit.haley.low_hearts.3": "I suppose I'm not doing anything better. Don't expect me to enjoy this.",
  "dialogue.recruit.haley.low_hearts.4": "Why me? Oh, whatever. Let's just get this over with.",
  "dialogue.recruit.haley.low_hearts.5": "Okay, but I'm in charge of the playlist. Wait, you don't have a phone with you, do you? Ugh.",

  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.low_hearts.1": "Finally. I need to go fix my hair. See you.",
  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.low_hearts.2": "Was that it? Good. I'm going back to civilization.",
  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.low_hearts.3": "Okay, I've had enough 'outdoors' for one day. Bye.",
  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.low_hearts.4": "Don't call me, I'll call you. Actually, don't expect it.",
  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.low_hearts.5": "I'm leaving. This outfit is not meant for... whatever this was.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.generic.1": "So, are we just going to stand here? This is so boring.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.generic.2": "My phone has no signal out here. How do people live like this?",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.generic.3": "I'm pretty sure I just saw a spider. Just saying.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.generic.4": "Could you, like, walk a little faster? Or slower? I don't know, just do something.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.generic.5": "Let me know when we're going somewhere with actual floors.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.farm.1": "Is this really how you spend your days? So much dirt...",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.farm.2": "It smells like... grass. And mud. Gross.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.farm.3": "Your house is... rustic. Yeah, that's a good word for it.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.farm.4": "Do you have animals? They don't bite, do they?",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.farm.5": "I'm trying to imagine a cute outfit for farming. Coming up blank.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.mines.1": "Ew, it smells so gross in here! And it's dark! I'm going to ruin my shoes.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.mines.2": "There are probably bats in here. BATS. I hate them.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.mines.3": "Okay, this is officially the least glamorous place I have ever been.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.mines.4": "If my hair gets frizzy from this damp air, I'm blaming you.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.mines.5": "Why are all the rocks so... pointy? This place has zero aesthetic.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.town.1": "The best thing about Pelican Town is the road leading out of it. Kidding! Mostly.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.town.2": "Ugh, I can feel everyone staring. This town is one big gossip circle.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.town.3": "Look at the 'fashion' here. It's like a history museum, but with more overalls.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.town.4": "If I have to look at that boring fountain one more time, I'm going to scream.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.town.5": "Is there anything to do here besides... walking around? No? Cool.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.house.1": "Welcome to my humble abode. And I do mean humble.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.house.2": "Don't mind Emily's weird stuff. I try to ignore the smell of sage.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.house.3": "My room is the only place in this house with any real style.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.house.4": "I swear, if Emily has left her sewing stuff on the couch again...",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.low_hearts.house.5": "It's so quiet here. Too quiet. I need some city noise.",

  "dialogue.attacking.haley.low_hearts.1": "Get away from me, you ugly thing!",
  "dialogue.attacking.haley.low_hearts.2": "Ew, ew, ew! Shoo!",
  "dialogue.attacking.haley.low_hearts.3": "Don't let it touch me!",
  "dialogue.attacking.haley.low_hearts.4": "This is disgusting! Do something!",
  "dialogue.attacking.haley.low_hearts.5": "Ugh! It's even slimier up close!",

  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.low_hearts.1": "You expect me to swing an axe? Seriously? My nails!",
  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.low_hearts.2": "This is manual labor. I don't do manual labor.",
  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.low_hearts.3": "Can't you just buy wood? From a store?",
  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.low_hearts.4": "There are splinters everywhere! This is a nightmare.",
  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.low_hearts.5": "Okay, one swing. That's all you're getting.",

  "dialogue.mining.haley.low_hearts.1": "I am NOT getting calluses for this. Just so you know.",
  "dialogue.mining.haley.low_hearts.2": "So I just... hit it? With a pickaxe? That seems so primitive.",
  "dialogue.mining.haley.low_hearts.3": "This is so going to mess up my manicure.",
  "dialogue.mining.haley.low_hearts.4": "Why don't they sell pre-cracked rocks?",
  "dialogue.mining.haley.low_hearts.5": "I hope there's not a bug under this rock. I swear...",

  "dialogue.watering.haley.low_hearts.1": "Watering plants. Groundbreaking.",
  "dialogue.watering.haley.low_hearts.2": "Great. Now my shoes are muddy.",
  "dialogue.watering.haley.low_hearts.3": "So you just... pour water on dirt. And you enjoy this?",
  "dialogue.watering.haley.low_hearts.4": "I feel like I should be wearing designer rain boots for this.",
  "dialogue.watering.haley.low_hearts.5": "This is exactly as boring as it looks.",

  // --- HIGH FRIENDSHIP (>= 6 HEARTS) ---
  // ==========================================

  "dialogue.recruit.haley.high_hearts.1": "An adventure with you? Of course! It sounds like fun. Let's take some great pictures!",
  "dialogue.recruit.haley.high_hearts.2": "I was hoping you'd ask! I cleared my schedule. Lead the way!",
  "dialogue.recruit.haley.high_hearts.3": "Yes! I'd love to come with you. What's the plan for today?",
  "dialogue.recruit.haley.high_hearts.4": "Absolutely! It's always better when we're together.",
  "dialogue.recruit.haley.high_hearts.5": "I'd follow you anywhere. Let's go make some memories!",

  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.high_hearts.1": "Okay! That was fun. Let's do this again sometime, okay?",
  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.high_hearts.2": "Alright, I'll head back. Thanks for inviting me along!",
  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.high_hearts.3": "It was great spending time with you. Talk to you later!",
  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.high_hearts.4": "I should probably go now. It was a really nice day!",
  "dialogue.dismiss.haley.high_hearts.5": "Okay, be safe! Let me know when you get home.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.generic.1": "I'm having a really nice time, you know? Just being with you.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.generic.2": "This is way more fun than just staying at home.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.generic.3": "The lighting right now is gorgeous. Smile!",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.generic.4": "I used to think this town was boring, but you make it an adventure.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.generic.5": "Whatever we do next, I know it'll be great.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.farm.1": "It's actually really pretty out here. The light is perfect for photos.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.farm.2": "Your animals are so cute! Can I take a picture of them?",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.farm.3": "You've worked so hard on this place. It really shows.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.farm.4": "The air feels so fresh and clean out here. It's nice.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.farm.5": "I love seeing the flowers you've planted. They have such nice colors.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.mines.1": "It's a little spooky, but I'm not scared when I'm with you. Let's find some shiny gems!",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.mines.2": "The way the torchlight reflects off the walls is kind of beautiful, isn't it?",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.mines.3": "Stay close! I'll keep an eye out for monsters.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.mines.4": "I wonder if we'll find an amethyst? Emily would love that.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.mines.5": "This is way more exciting than I thought it would be!",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.volcano.1": "Wow, it's hot! But look at all the amazing colors. This is a photographer's dream!",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.volcano.2": "Be careful near the lava! I don't want you to get hurt.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.volcano.3": "This is the most exotic place I've ever seen. It's incredible!",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.volcano.4": "I never would have been brave enough to come here alone. Thanks for bringing me.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.volcano.5": "The pictures I'm going to get from this trip will be legendary!",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.town.1": "It's nice to walk through town and say hi to everyone. I actually know people now!",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.town.2": "The community garden is looking really cute. Pam's been taking good care of it.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.town.3": "Sometimes I just like to sit by the river. It's so peaceful and makes for great pictures.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.town.4": "You know, this little town has a certain charm. I get why people like it here.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.town.5": "Maybe we'll see Alex. He's always out here practicing with his gridball.",

  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.house.1": "It's nice to be home for a bit. It's cozy, you know?",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.house.2": "I was just in my darkroom. I think I got a really great shot of a butterfly.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.house.3": "Sometimes Emily's crystal collection catches the light just right. It's actually kind of pretty.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.house.4": "This place holds a lot of memories. Good ones, mostly.",
  "dialogue.idle.haley.high_hearts.house.5": "I should probably help Emily tidy up later. It's our house, after all.",

  "dialogue.attacking.haley.high_hearts.1": "Don't worry, I'll help! Stay back!",
  "dialogue.attacking.haley.high_hearts.2": "I've got your back! Hya!",
  "dialogue.attacking.haley.high_hearts.3": "Leave my friend alone!",
  "dialogue.attacking.haley.high_hearts.4": "We can take it! Together!",
  "dialogue.attacking.haley.high_hearts.5": "You messed with the wrong farmer... and photographer!",

  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.high_hearts.1": "Teamwork! Let's clear this out. It's a surprisingly good workout.",
  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.high_hearts.2": "Here, I can help with that. Let me take a swing!",
  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.high_hearts.3": "Watch out!",
  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.high_hearts.4": "Two of us make this go way faster.",
  "dialogue.lumbering.haley.high_hearts.5": "More wood for your farm. It's the least I can do.",

  "dialogue.mining.haley.high_hearts.1": "Maybe we'll find a pretty crystal!",
  "dialogue.mining.haley.high_hearts.2": "Let's crack this one open. Maybe there's a geode inside!",
  "dialogue.mining.haley.high_hearts.3": "I'm stronger than I look, you know.",
  "dialogue.mining.haley.high_hearts.4": "I'll handle this. You save your energy.",
  "dialogue.mining.haley.high_hearts.5": "This is actually kind of fun!",

  "dialogue.watering.haley.high_hearts.1": "Here, let me help with that. Everything on your farm is so lovely.",
  "dialogue.watering.haley.high_hearts.2": "The plants will be so happy! They'll grow big and strong.",
  "dialogue.watering.haley.high_hearts.3": "It feels good to help out. Your farm is becoming so beautiful.",
  "dialogue.watering.haley.high_hearts.4": "Many hands make light work, right?",
  "dialogue.watering.haley.high_hearts.5": "There! All nice and watered."
